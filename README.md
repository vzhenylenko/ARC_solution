# ARC (UNFINISHED, AT EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT)
#### Overview
System dedicated to solve problems from ARC dataset (universal IQ test)  

#### What is **ARC**. It's a challenge, proposed by Francois Chollet [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

#### DONE:
- output list of figures based on to type of cell's neighbourhood (Moore and reduced von Neunman neighbourhoods)  
  
#### TODO:
- create list of relations
- create graph of relations between figures in input and output
- create difference relation between representations
- search for greatest common subgraphs in differences
- add difference to target picture representation
- create answer from obtained representation

#### Examples:
